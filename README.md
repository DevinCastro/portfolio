#React Portfolio


App deployed at: http://DevinCastro.github.io/portfolio

### Description:
>This is my personal web developer portfolio create with react.  Here you can find my professional portfolio of my recent projects that I made.  On the portfolio page you can find all the information about these projects as well as their links to deployed apps, links to repos, and a screenshot of the application.   

## Technologies Used:
This is a React application made with create-react-app.  This portfolio is strictly just front end. I built a single 'project' component to dynamically render each project with the same code.
